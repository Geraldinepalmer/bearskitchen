   <p>A well-balanced diet includes 
      the right food groups in the right proportions. 
      So a complete and balanced homemade diet consists of:<br>

<br>40% Protein
<br>10% Carbohydrates
<br> 50% Vegetables
  <br>Healthy Fats
  <br>Calcium
 <br>Fatty acids
 <br>But don't worry about balancing out every single meal. The aim is to create an overall balance.</p>

       <p>
          Hereâ€™s how to make it:<br>
         
         <br>Ingredients<br>
         
         <br>1kg of lean minced beef
         <br>250g of brown rice
        <br> 100g of spinach
         <br>100g of peas
        <br> 2 grated carrots
         <br>2 grated courgettes<br>
        <br> Method
         
         <br>Cook the rice according to the packet instructions and set aside.
         In a large pan or casserole, fry the minced beef in a little olive oil. Be sure to break down the meat and continue to cook until fully browned.
         Add in the spinach, carrot, courgette and peas and a splash of water to help soften. Cook for around 3 minutes, until the spinach is wilted and the veg is fully heated.
         Turn off the heat, pour in your rice and stir to combine.
         Cool before serving or storing.
